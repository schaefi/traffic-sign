traffic sign
============

This project originates from:

* https://debuggercafe.com/traffic-sign-recognition-using-pytorch-and-deep-learning/
* https://www.v7labs.com/open-datasets/gtsrb

Thanks much for providing this data and code

The project is only used to setup a traffic sign detection on a raspberry PI
and serves the purpose for learning a bit about deep learning models (https://pytorch.org)
and classification systems. The code I added is of poor quality and I don't
recommend anybody to use it ;)
